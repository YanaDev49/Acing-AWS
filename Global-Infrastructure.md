### AWS regions are distinct georgraphic areas where Amazon Web Services data centres are located.

- Each region is a seperate area that contains multiple data centres, known as Availability Zones. This is important because it helps ensure redundancy and high availibility for your applications.

- If something goes wrong in one data center AWS can automatically switch to another in the same region to keep things running smoothly. AWS has regions in North America, Europe, Asia Australia and much more.

- Most AWS services are region scopes which means that when you use a service like 𝗘𝗖𝟮 or create an 𝗦𝟯 𝗯𝘂𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁, its tied to the certain region you've chosen. This is important because where your data lives can impact performance and even compliance within local regulations.

### AWS regions are all about giving you control of where your data and services live, which is a big deal for companies. You need to keep close eye on customers or follow certain rules about what data is stored
