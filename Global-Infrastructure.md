### AWS regions are distinct georgraphic areas where Amazon Web Services data centres are located.

- Each region is a seperate area that contains multiple data centres, known as Availability Zones. This is important because it helps ensure redundancy and high availibility for your applications.

- 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Compliance is really important because if youre working in industries with strict data governance and legal requirements like the government, some businesses are required by law to keep their data in a certain country or region. AWS helps with that by ensuring your data never leaves the region unless you give permission

- 𝗔𝘃𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝗔 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗼𝗻: Not Every AWS Service is available in every region. Some regions might have fewer services or might not have the latest features, so if you need to use a certain service, you should check whether its available in your region. Despite this, AWS adds services all the time however they dont always release it to every region at once.
