Amazon Compute refers to the range of services in AWS that provide the processing power needed to run applications, websites, and other workloads. The most common service in this category is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), which lets you run virtual servers (instances) in the cloud, but there are other key services too.

- Amazon EC2 Provides scalable virtual servers where you can run your applications. You can choose instance types based on your processing needs, storage, and memory requirements.

- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service where you donâ€™t manage servers. You simply upload your code, and it runs automatically in response to events like file uploads or HTTP requests. It's ideal for tasks that only need to run when triggered.

- AWS ECS/EKS are Services for running and managing containers at scale. ECS uses AWS's own orchestrator, while EKS is based on Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration tool.

Amazon Compute services provide flexibility and scalability, allowing you to run anything from small-scale applications to large, globally distributed systems. These services allow you to only pay for the computing power you actually use, making it cost-efficient!
