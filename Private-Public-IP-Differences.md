### Public IP addresses are accessible from the internet

- This is the address that everyone on the internet can see and use to reach your device (like a website, server, or router).

### Public IP addresses are unique worldwide 

- This means that no two devices on the internet can have the same public IP.

- Public IP addresses are used when you want to connect with devices outside your network

 ## Private IP addresses

 ### Private IP addresses are accessible within your local network 

 -  Devices like your phone, laptop, or printer use private IPs to talk to each other within that network.

### Private IP addresses are not unique globally

- The same private IP addresses can be used in different networks (like at your house and mine) without conflict.
- Private IP addresses are used for devices that donâ€™t need to be directly accessed from the internet.

### And There You Have It!!
