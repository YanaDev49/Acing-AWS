# What is EC2 User Data?

EC2 User Data is like a little to-do list for your server that you can set up when it first starts. Imagine you’re turning on a brand-new computer, and you want it to automatically do a few things, like install software, update itself, or run a script. Instead of manually logging in and doing all that yourself, you can use EC2 User Data to make it happen automatically.

Here’s how it works: when you launch an EC2 instance, you can give it some "User Data" (usually in the form of a script). This script runs right after the instance starts. So, for example, if you want to install Apache (a web server), you could include that command in your User Data, and EC2 will handle it without you having to lift a finger.

It’s a one-time thing though—EC2 User Data only runs the first time the instance starts up. So, it’s super handy for automating setup tasks that you need done right away.
