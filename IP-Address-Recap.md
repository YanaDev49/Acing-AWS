Understanding IP addresses is one of the most important concepts in both networking and AWS so lets go through them again! practice makes perfect 😁🙌

## IPv4

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the original system used to assign addresses to devices on the internet.
It uses a 32-bit address, which looks something like: 192.168.1.1.
There are around 4.3 billion possible IP addresses with IPv4, which seemed like plenty when the internet was first created, but eventually, we started running out of these addresses as more and more devices got connected (phones, computers, smart devices, etc.).

## IPv6

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the newer system that was created to solve the problem of running out of IPv4 addresses.
It uses a 128-bit address, which looks more like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. (Yeah, it's way longer!)
IPv6 can support 340 undecillion IP addresses, so there's no risk of running out of addresses any time soon.


## So why did IPv6 Come out? 🤔

IPv4 was running out of addresses because the internet grew so fast with more devices, websites, and services coming online. IPv6 was introduced to make sure there were enough IP addresses to go around for the future. Plus, IPv6 has some technical improvements over IPv4, like better security and more efficient routing, but the main reason was simply to deal with the shortage of IP addresses!

### And there you have it‼️
