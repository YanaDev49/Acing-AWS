AWS, also known as Amazon Web Services, is a platform that provides a wide range of cloud computing services. This means that instead of needing to buy and maintain physical servers, companies and developers can use AWS to rent databases, storage, computing power, and other resources over the internet.

Amazon Web Services was created by Amazon, and it was officially launched in the year 2006. It started out as a way for Amazon to use its existing infrastructure to offer computing and storage services to other companies. At the time, Amazon had built a powerful infrastructure to run its own online business and realised they could offer those same services to other businesses.
