AWS, also known as Amazon Web Services, is a platform that provides a wide range of cloud computing services. This means that instead of needing to buy and maintain physical servers, companies and developers can use AWS to rent databases, storage, computing power, and other resources over the internet.

AWS allows businesses to scale up and down quickly, only paying for what they use. This makes it easier and more cost-effective to manage IT infrastructure.
