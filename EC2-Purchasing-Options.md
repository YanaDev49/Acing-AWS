#### Did you know that there are different purchasing options for EC2 instances? These purchasing options depend on the storage, workload and time length of use for your instance!

| **Purchasing Option**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Demand Instances**  | Pay for what you use by the hour or second, no long-term commitment. Itâ€™s flexible but can get expensive if you leave instances running all the time.         |
| **Reserved Instances**   | You commit to using an instance for 1 or 3 years in exchange for a big discount (up to 75%). Great for predictable, long-term workloads.                     |
| **Savings Plan**         | Similar to Reserved Instances, but with more flexibility. You commit to a specific amount of usage (in $/hour) for 1 or 3 years and get discounted rates.    |
| **Spot Instances**       | Super cheap, but the catch is that Amazon can take them back at any time if they need the capacity. Perfect for flexible, non-critical workloads.            |
| **Dedicated Hosts**      | You rent a *physical* server thatâ€™s only yours. Great for things like regulatory requirements or software licensing that needs dedicated hardware.            |
| **Dedicated Instances**  | Like Dedicated Hosts, but instead of renting a whole server, you rent virtual instances on hardware thatâ€™s only used by you. You still share some resources. |
| **Capacity Reservations**| You reserve capacity in a specific Availability Zone for whenever you need it. It guarantees that space will be available, but you only pay when itâ€™s used.  |

### And There You Have It!
