An Elastic IP in AWS is basically a public IP address that you can move around between your EC2 instances. Normally, when you stop and restart an EC2 instance, its public IP changes. But with an Elastic IP, you can keep the same public IP even if the instance is stopped or replaced.

## So how are they so helpful?

### Consistency

- If you want your server to always be reachable at the same IP (like a website or service that people need to access), Elastic IP makes sure the IP doesnâ€™t change.

### Flexibility

- You can switch the Elastic IP between different instances if something goes wrong, making it easier to recover without messing with DNS or other configurations.

### In summary,  itâ€™s just a static public IP that you can reuse and attach to different instances, keeping things stable and easy to manage.
