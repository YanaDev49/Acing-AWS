The AWS Command Line Interface is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with AWS Services directly!

Instead of using the management console, you can use the Command Line Interface to automate tasks, run commands or script workflows (Definetely sounds like a DevOps Engineers dreamðŸ˜„)
Its powerful becauseit allows you to interact with any AWS service using simple commands, and its ideal for automating deployments or managing resources on a larger scale. 

With the AWS CLI you get direct access to the public API's of AWS meaning that you can use commands to launch ec2 instances or any services you want to use in the console
