| **ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)** | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Ensures no single server gets overwhelmed, improving availability and fault tolerance.|
| **ASG (Auto Scaling Group)**    | Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic or load. Adds instances when demand increases and scales down when it decreases, helping manage resources and costs efficiently. |
